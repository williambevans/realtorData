# 🏡 Realtor Data Transparency Tracker

**URL:** [williambevans.github.io/realtorData](https://williambevans.github.io/realtorData)

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This project was created to promote **transparency and accountability** around how **Realtor-entered listing data** is redistributed after it's entered into a local MLS system.

As brokers, agents, and clients rely on the integrity and visibility of listing data, it is critical to understand **who has access to it, where it goes, and how it’s monetized** once it leaves the MLS.

---

## 📊 What This Page Shows

This site and data visualization aim to:
- Display examples of where broker-submitted MLS data may be redistributed.
- Expose common syndication endpoints (e.g., Zillow, Realtor.com, Homes.com).
- Show relationships between MLS systems, third-party vendors, and data licensing entities.
- Highlight **potential conflicts of interest** where third parties profit without returning value to brokers who generated the data.

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

Brokers often:
- Have **no opt-out control** once data leaves the MLS pipeline.
- Are **unaware** of how many entities resell, rebrand, or rehost their listing data.
- Fund the very systems (through dues) that enable these redistributions — often **without consent, oversight, or compensation**.

This repo supports:
- **Open-source advocacy** for agent rights.
- **Policy reform efforts** at NAR, RESO, and MLS boards.
- Discussions around **data ownership, licensing, and ethics** in real estate technology.
